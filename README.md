# Collaboration-Hub

Description

This project is a collaboration tool between different team members around the globe working on a same project.
Great place to start collaborating among a team of two or more people or organizations working together to complete a task or achieve a goal.

Collaboration relies on openness and knowledge sharing but also some level of focus and accountability on the part of the business organizations.

Governance should be established addressing the creation and closing of team workspaces with assignment of responsibility for capturing the emergent results of the collaborative effort.
